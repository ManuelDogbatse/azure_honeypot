# SSH Honeypot

This is a simple SSH honeypot made with Python using the paramiko library for SSH servers, and the socket library for network sockets.

Here are the sources I used to make this honeypot:
- [0xdf - Creating a SSH Honeypot with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO1h57CiF98&t=435s)
- [How to build an SSH honeypot in Python and Docker - Part 1](https://securehoney.net/blog/how-to-build-an-ssh-honeypot-in-python-and-docker-part-1.html)
- [Paramiko Documentation](https://docs.paramiko.org/en/latest/)
